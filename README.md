My name is Robert Struthers, and I am currently pursuing a Bacherlors of Fine Arts with a Graphic Design specialization as well as a Math minor and Computer Science minor from Central Washington University. 
<br><br>
I am currently learning 3D modeling, animating, and VFX for game development. My goal is to become a technical artist working on video games so that I can express my creativity and demonstrate my technical knowledge simutanously.
